# Artistic-Style-Analysis

In this notebook, weâ€™ll explore how to use multimodal embeddings and computed attributes to analyze artistic styles in images. Weâ€™ll use the WikiArt dataset from ðŸ¤— Hub, which we will load into FiftyOne for data analysis and visualization. Weâ€™ll dive into the data in a variety of ways:

Image Similarity Search and Semantic Search: Weâ€™ll generate multimodal embeddings for the images in the dataset using a pre-trained CLIP model from ðŸ¤— Transformers and index the data to allow for unstructured searches.

Clustering and Visualization: Weâ€™ll cluster the images based on their artistic style using the embeddings and visualize the results using UMAP dimensionality reduction.

Uniqueness Analysis: Weâ€™ll use our embeddings to assign a uniqueness score to each image based on how similar it is to other images in the dataset.

Image Quality Analysis: Weâ€™ll compute image quality metrics like brightness, contrast, and saturation for each image and see how these metrics correlate with the artistic style of the images.
